In order to meet the requirements of legislation 
it is planned to replace the procedure of opening the card 
accounts within the salary-card projects. 
For that it is proposed to carry out the 
opening of accounts after the acquisition 
of identification documents and the signing of the 
contract with the client, and to pre-reserve the 
account numbers using it to print the client contracts.
